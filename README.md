# lab_implement-and-manage-nginx

Each challenge has a directory with the config files as of the end of the challenge:

- Drop any of these files into `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
- and then `sudo nginx -s reload`

I recommend using two VSCode instances: `code ~/lab`, `code /etc/nginx/` and then copy/paste files with the Explorer panel.
